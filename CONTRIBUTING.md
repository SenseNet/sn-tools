# How to contribute
Thank you for checking out our project! :star2: :sunny: :deciduous_tree: :earth_americas:

All kinds of contributions are welcome, including ideas, requests for improvement, bugfixes or features. We are happy if you simply use these projects, but it is marvelous :sparkling_heart: if you decide to make your changes public for the benefit of others.

Please start by [creating an issue](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-tools/issues) (if you do not find an existing one for the subject).

## Reporting a bug
When creating a bug report, please:

- Provide a short, clear **title** and **description**.
- State the exact **version** you are using.
- List the steps you took (where did you click?).
- Code samples, screenshots, **log entries** (Event log, [SnTrace](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-tools/tree/master/src/SenseNet.Tools/Diagnostics), UI error messages) are welcome!
